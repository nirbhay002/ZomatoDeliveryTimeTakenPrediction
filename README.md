**Zomato Delivery Time Prediction Model**  
**End-to-End Machine Learning Project**  

ðŸš€ Developed a Zomato delivery time prediction model! This project involved building a complete end-to-end ML pipelineâ€”from data ingestion and transformation to model training and deployment. I integrated the model with a Flask web application, creating a seamless experience for training and predictions. While the initial accuracy wasn't as high as desired, I'm committed to learning and applying more advanced ML algorithms to enhance the model's performance. I'm excited to apply these improvements to larger datasets for even better results in the future!

**Creating the Environment:**
```
conda create -p venv python==3.8
conda activate venv/
```

**Installing Necessary Libraries:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
